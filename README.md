Data-Structure project using (c++)

The market management system is designed to provide a comprehensive platform that caters to both customers and sellers. The system allows customers to browse through the products, add them to their cart, purchase them, and rate products. It also enables sellers to add products to the inventory, edit or delete them, and set prices for their products.

and here are some of its features:

-The system uses the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol to enable the user to retrieve his data through his Gmail.

-The system also includes a server component built using socket programming. This server enables the system developers to have better control over the flow of data and to track user activityÂ such as purchases, sales, and product ratings.

-Login and register page to enable users to sign up and log in as either a seller or a
customer or both.

-Sellers can add products to the inventory, edit or delete them, and set prices for their
products.

-The system uses data structures like BST and linked lists to store and manage the
products and user information.

-The graphical user interface (GUI) provides an easy-to-use interface for customers and
sellers to interact with the system, made with winforms C#.
